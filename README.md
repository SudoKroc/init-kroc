# init-kroc
Welcome! This is the beginning of my hands-on journey into IT, Linux, and Cloud technologies.

This repo will document my progress through self-guided learning and projects that build real-world skills. It’s part learning journal, part project archive, and part experiment.

## Goals

- Learn Linux through hands-on scripting and daily use
- Prepare for CompTIA A+ and transition into a cloud/IT career
- Build projects that reflect my growth and creativity
- Eventually develop a Linux-based dashboard that integrates with HomeKit

## Current Focus

- Linux terminal basics
- Bash scripting
- System automation
- Structuring projects and using Git/GitHub

## Project Structure

Each folder in this repo will represent a milestone or project in my journey. Examples:
- `linux-basics/` – CLI practice and simple scripts
- `kroc-board/` – Dashboard project (planned)
- `notes/` – Study notes, code snippets, personal docs

## Why “init-kroc”?

"init" is the first process started on Linux during boot — and this is the beginning of mine.
